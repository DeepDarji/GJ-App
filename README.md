1 - INTRODUCTION
1.1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION
To solve more data usage or more specification needed and privacy issues
we decided to make the application and solve these two problems. We all
decided that we would create an app that would work for all and sundry.
So we make the multipurpose application with the lower storage and it
needs lower specifications.

1.2 PURPOSE
This project is aimed at developing an Application, which is of importance
to all mobile phone(android phone) users. This is a free to use application
that can be accessed by everyone from everywhere. This application uses
multiple applications in just one application. With the use of this
application you don't need to download many applications or you don't
need to find one by one application. Also it is free to use or access so
everyone can use this application on their mobile phones.

1.3 PROBLEM IN EXISTING SYSTEM
There are many applications like this but also those applications have
many problems. We defined all the problems below.
● Cannot Download the latest updates.
● Less Security or Data mining which can misuse your data.
● Not user friendly.
● Some applications are not free to use.
● Many ads in applications.
● Need higher specifications.
● Need more space to install and use it.

● Some applications are not multipurpose, it just redirects to other
applications.

1.4 SOLUTION OF THESE PROBLEMS
To solve this above all problem we decided to find all the solutions onw by
one and implement it in our application. All the solutions we defined
below.
❖ User friendliness is provided in the application with various controls.
❖ Update the application regularly.
❖ For security we can't use your data or internet to mine your data or
use it. Internet use only when you use a browser in an application
then only mobile data is used there.
❖ Make it free to download and free to use application.
❖ No ads are implemented so users can't redirect to the browser or
any other applications.
❖ Make the application lightweight so it doesn't need higher
specification or high space.
❖ Can't redirect to other applications, just add or implement
applications in one application.
